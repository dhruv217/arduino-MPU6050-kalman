# arduino-MPU6050-kalman
A arduino MPU6050 based hand movement recognizer by calculating roll, pitch and yaw.

To test the Arduino MPU 6050, first download the Arduino library for MPU 6050, developed by Jeff Rowberg. You can find the library [here](http://diyhacking.com/projects/MPU6050.zip). Next, you have to unzip/extract this library and take the folder named “MPU6050” and paste it inside the Arduino’s “library” folder. To do this, go to the location where you have installed Arduino (Arduino –> libraries) and paste it inside the libraries folder. You might also have to do the same thing to install the I2Cdev library if you don’t already have it for your Arduino. Do the same procedure as above to install it, you can find the file here: [I2Cdev](http://diyhacking.com/projects/I2Cdev.zip) library.
